# UnknownEngine

Unkown Engine is our project for "Engines" subject at CITM's videogames design & development. 
This time, we will be working on the creation of the core of a videogames engine, 
focusing on basic level stuff in order to understand how a high level engine works.

## Controls

##Top menus

* File: For exiting application.
* Help: Github related stuff.
* Settings: OpenGL settings + hardware specs, input logs, console, windows settings, plots of fps...
* Primitives: Menu for creating sphere, cones, cylinders and cubes.

### Camera

* Right Click after pressing F: Orbitates the camera around the game object.
* Alt + Right Click: Orbitates the camera.
* WASD: To move around the viewport.

### Hierarchy

Each time a gameobject is added into the engine, a item is created on the hierarchy window, from here
you can see its children and select the object.

* Double click on an item: Selects the item.
* Single click on an item: Unfolds its children.
